Arturo is a [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson1/) application designed to provide an interactive tour of the [Cleveland Museum of Art](https://www.clevelandart.org/) (CMA). You can select an exhibit and browse through the artwork, while enjoying insights and fun facts about each piece.

I have no affiliation with the museum. This is just an experimental project for me to learn more about creating Shiny apps and chat-bots. Also, the CMA is awesome, and the project was a neat way to explore and learn more about it.
